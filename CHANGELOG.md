# Changes

## 0.3.0

Judgement is unchanged: criteria stay at v2, and the recorded test pages give
the same verdicts as under 0.2.

- **Redirects.** A redirect is followed only where `robots.txt` admits the
  address it leads to; a closed address is never requested. A mandate for one
  site does not open another. A page moved by a script to a closed address is
  not recorded.
- **What was asked, and what rendered.** An observation keeps the address
  requested beside the one reached, and the browser version that rendered it.
  Both appear in `atlas`; the browser appears in the `facts` header.
- **The same bytes on every system.** The observer and the kernel read and
  write UTF-8 with line feeds whatever the platform. Before, the observer
  used the system encoding, which mangled accented text on Windows.
- **Tests without a shell.** `tests/run.py` replaces `run.sh` and
  `observe.sh`; `--accept` and `--record` do what the scripts did.
- **Releases.** One binary per system, each under its own name:
  `releve-linux`, `releve-macos`, `releve-windows.exe`. Before, the Linux and
  macOS binaries shared a name and one replaced the other.
- A test page that writes in the report's own syntax: its text stays text.
- A damaged corpus is refused with the line at fault, not a stack trace.
- Pages are rendered without downloads and without service workers.
- Playwright is pinned in `observe/requirements.txt`.

## 0.2.0

- Footprint as raw measures (elements, requests, kilobytes, third-party
  hosts); no score.
- The observer's conduct written into the code and tested: `robots.txt`,
  pace, refusals, mandate, contact address.
- Criteria v2: `image-weight` judges bitmap images only.
- REUSE-compliant licence headers.
